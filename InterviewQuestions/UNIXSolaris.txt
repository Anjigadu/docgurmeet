Unix admin questions

How do you list the files in an UNIX directory while also showing hidden files?
ls -l / ls -a

How do you execute a UNIX command in the background?
Use ampersand '&'

What UNIX command will control the default file permissions when files are created?
umask


Explain the read, write, and execute permissions on a UNIX directory.

4->read
2->write
1->execute
root have full permission-> 777
777(4+2+1).
rwxrwxrwx–>means
first rwx –> user
second rwx–> group
third rwx –> other
777 means full permission.
—————-
apply permission
—————-
chmod 755
755 means–>
user have full permission
group&others have read and execution.


What is the difference between a soft link and a hard link?
 hard link means two inodes link to same file. soft link creates a seperate file
softlink have different inode and permissions started with l.
hardlink have samw node and permission not start with l.
softlink–>
ln -s file newfile
//-s is symbolic(soft)
ll -il //shows file with inode.
newfile->file
——————————–
hardlink–>
ln file newfile
ll -il


Give the command to display space usage on the UNIX file system.
df -h or du 


Explain iostat, vmstat and netstat.
iostat returns disk and other data i/o statistics vmstat returns memory paging statistics, virtual and real, netsta returns network statistics. GENERALLY the first line or the command alone will return statistical averages since boottime; the commands can also be run with flags to report instantaneous snapshots every x seconds for y results (ie vmstat 5 5 gives a snapshot every 5 seconds 5 times in a row


How would you change all occurrences of a value using VI?
vi to substitute every occurance in a file: %s/OLD/NEW/g


Give two UNIX kernel parameters that effect an Oracle install
shared memory and semaphores: shmmmax, shmmmin, etc and seminfo_semmsl (both affect the memory useage and sharing at the kernel level and usually a reboot is necessary for them to take affect safely (kernel parameters can be updated live on many Unix OS’s but is not recommended unless you are at the expert level and have performed the task before successfully on a sandbox)


Briefly, how do you install Oracle software on UNIX.
Oracle can be installed from CD or better yet from CD’s copied in their entirety to a hard disk simply with the “runInstall” script. a) make sure the filesystems you will be installing to have enough space AND no previous Oracle installation upon them and b) MUST be run as the Oracle user NOT root. (ie: you need to have an oracle user account created with the proper rwx rights to the installation target filesystem) c) several key variables such as hostname, some kernel parameters, and a few other pre-installation tasks need to be performed dependent upon the OS Oracle will be run upon.

QNo:10. What is SED?
SED (which stands for Stream EDitor) is a simple but powerful computer program used to apply various pre-specified textual transformations to a sequential stream of text data.
It reads input files line by line, edits each line according to rules specified in its simple language (the sed script), and then outputs the line.

Jaffar

AWK is a complete pattern scanning and processing language, it is most commonly used as a Unix command-line filter to reformat the output of other commands.
For example, to print only the second and sixth fields of the date command (the month and year) with a space separating them, at the Unix prompt, you would enter:
date | awk ‘{print $2 ” ” $6}’

Access rights (read/write/execute) on a directory means:
->read indicates that it is possible to list files in the directory.
->write indicates that it is possible to delete or move files in the directory.
->execute indicates that it is possible to read files in the directory provided we must have read permission on individual files of that directory.

comment 3 on directory execute permissions is incorrect;
Execute permission on a directory means you can list the files in that directory.

11. What is the difference between binaries in /bin, and /usr/bin?
/bin - would contains the binaries frequently used by the normal user (as well as system administrator)
/usr/bin - would contains the binaries rarely used by the normal user (as wel as system administrator)
12. What is a dynamically linked file?
soft link (created with ln -s). Source and destination files will have the different inode. If dest removed source will be available. If source removed dest also will available but no where to go.
13. What is a statically linked file?
hard link (created with ln). Source and dest will have the same inode. Making two different copies causes more disk space due to redundancy.

Comment #10 is in error with all answers
11. What is the difference between binaries in /bin, and /usr/bin?
Under Solaris, there is no difference. /bin is a symbolic link pointing to /usr/bin. Under Linux (RHAS3) /bin is seemingly for standard unix programs like vi, cp, mv, rm which you’d need in a single user environment where as /usr/bin contains programs you’d want for a multiuser environment. Keep in mind that sometimes /usr is a different disk partition and when you start up in single user mode you only have / mounted.
The /sbin directories are *supposed to* contain statically linked programs. This mas morphed into the idea of bin for user programs, sbin for admin programs.
12. What is a dynamically linked file?
This is confusing because of the use of the word ‘file’. A dynamically linked program is one that, when executed, loads shared libraries from /lib or /usr/lib in order to execute. The idea is that most programs use many of the same functions, so include a copy of a common function in *every* program on the file system. Instead, the function is placed in a shared library and when the program starts executing, the library is loaded which provides the program access to the function.
13. What is a statically linked file?
As above, confusing due to the use of the word ‘file’. A statically linked program is one that contains all the information (libraries) it needs to run. It does not need to load additional libaries in order to execute.

for comment no: 12
Mutex:
Short for mutual exclusion object. In computer programming, a mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously. When a program is started, a mutex is created with a unique name. After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. The mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.
INode:
a unique number associated with each filename. This number is used to look up an entry in the inode table which gives information on the type, size, and location of the file and the userid of the owner of the file.

Access rights (read/write/execute) on a directory means:
execute permission allows a user to enter the directory and perform read/write/execute files according to the permissions of the file. But you cannot ‘ls’ the directory until you have a read permission.
It means you should know the filename.
eg:
[amar@darkstar ~]$ ls -l | grep Book
d–x—— 6 amar amar 4096 Sep 5 11:27 BookScripting # directory only has
execute permission
[amar@darkstar ~]$ ls -l BookScripting/ # no read permission
ls: BookScripting/: Permission denied # so ‘ls -l’ denied
[amar@darkstar ~]$ ls -l BookScripting/test.sh
-r-x—— 1 amar amar 37 Sep 5 11:27 BookScripting/test.sh
[amar@darkstar ~]$ BookScripting/test.sh
you can execute
[amar@darkstar ~]$

I am looking to determine the total file size of my users, email the data daily, and have it reported in megs. I am using terminal and crontab sucessfully, but I can’t get the crontab entry to report the findings at the user account level. It seems to scan all the way to the end of a uses folder and then report that. Any suggestions?

Tech Interviews comment by Wing
Can you tell me what the administration issue is? Have you tried going to sun freeware and get the top package for SunOS 5.6 you will need Gzip to uncompress the file. Then you just run pkgadd -d {path}package-name and it will install without any issues.

Answer for #1
You can use this script under solaris(using “quot” as fundamental of script:-
#!/usr/bin/bash
cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd
cut -f1 -d: /tmp/passwd>/tmp/userids
quot -h / /usr /var > /tmp/quotaall
for name in `cat /tmp/userids` ;
do
grep $name /tmp/quotaall | awk ‘{print $1}’ > /tmp/userusagelist
sum=0;
for i in `cat /tmp/userusagelist`;
do
sum=`expr $sum + $i`;
done
summbs=`expr $sum / 1024`;
echo “$name is using $summbs MB”
done

6.What is LOM
Short for LAN on motherboard. The term refers to a chip or chipset capable of network connections that has been embedded directly on the motherboard of a desktop, workstation or server. Instead of requiring a separate network interface card to access a local-area network, such as Ethernet, the circuits are attached to the motherboard. An advantage of a LOM system is an extra available PCI slot that is not being used by the network adapter.

20) What does fmthard do?
The fmthard command updates the VTOC (Volume Table of Contents) on hard disks and, on systems, adds boot information,to the Solaris fdisk partition. One or more of the options,-s datafile, -d data, or -n volume_name must be used to request modifications to the disk label. To print disk label contents, see prtvtoc.The /dev/rdsk/c?[t?]d?s2 file must be the character special file of the device where the new label is to be installed. On systems, fdisk must be run on the drive before fmthard.

Used for adding packages to the OS
2. How do you create a solaris package?
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/solaris/sparc/html/creating.solaris.packages.html
3. How do you view shared memory statistics?
swap -l -> displays swap usage
prstat -> examines all active processes on the system and reports statistics based on the selected output mode and sort order
vmstat -> reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and cpu activity
pmap -> lists the virtual memory mappings underlying the given process
4. How do you get system diagnostics information?
prtdiag -v -> Shows mem, cpu, Power supply, add-on cards info, LEd status
iostat -En -> Shows disk status.(look for hard error)
/var/adm/messages -> Logs most commont failures and the entire system events
Extended POST -> This can be done at boot time.
ipmitool -> Shows voltage, fanspee, led status etc…
5. What is OBP and how do you access it?
Open Boot PROM -> Similar to a BIOS in a pc, but a lot more powerful
Stop+A -> from OS (Not recommended)
init 0 -> gracefully brings machine to ok> prompt from OS
6. What is LOM and how do you access it?
LOM -> Lights out manager
Powerful CLI interface which helps to get info about the Server
this can be connected via local (Serial management)
or over the LAN (Net management)
can be used for remote administration, diagnosing issues when machine fails to come up
LOM will be active long soon as power is coming to the Server
7. What is VTS?

9. What is /etc/system for?
The /etc/system file provides a static mechanism for adjusting the values of kernel parameters. Values specified in this file are read at boot time and are applied. Any changes that are made to the file are not applied to the operating system until the system is rebooted.
10. What does ndd do?
allows you to tune, tweak, set and reset various parameters related to the TCP/IP stack while the system is running
11. What does init 5 do?
Gracefully powers down the system (OS) and powers the machine off
12. What does init 0 do?
Gracefully powers down the system (OS) and drops to OBP ie ok> prompt

kernel tuning means to change kernel parameter in /etc/system
for ex:
#vi /etc/system file
set_maxuser 41 (40)
so whenever we want to edit and change the parameter in etc/system is called one kind of kernel tuning

Basic sed tricks

What is sed? - sed is stream editor, a Unix tool for working with streams of text data. See the awful truth about sed.


How do you substitute strings with sed? - Use ’s/old/new’ command, so sed ’s/hello/goodbye/’ would substitute the occurrence of the word hello to goodbye.


How do you inject text with sed? - & in the substitution string defines the pattern found in the search string. As an example, here’s us trying to find a word ‘hello’ and replacing it with ‘hello and how are you’:
     echo ‘hello there’ | sed ’s/^hello/& and how are you/’


Can I find several patterns and refer to them in the replacement string? - Yes, use (pattern) and then refer to your patterns as \1, \2, \3 and so on.


If the string is ‘old old old’ and I run ’s/old/new’, I get ‘new old old’ as the result. I need ‘new new new‘. - You forgot the global modifier, which would replace every occurrence of the pattern with the substitution. ’s/old/new/g‘ will work.


But I want ‘old old new’ from the previous example. - Just use the numeric modifier saying you want the third occurrence to be replaced. ’s/old/new/3‘ will work.


I wrote a rather complex sed script. How do I save and run it? - Assuming that your file is named myscript1.sed, you can invoke sed -f myscript1.sed.


How do I delete trailing whitespaces from each line? - sed ’s/[ \t]*$//’ Here we’re replacing any occurrence of a space or a tab with nothing. Check sed one-liners for more examples.


How do you print just a few first lines of the file? - sed 1q will give you just the first line, sed 10q the first 10 lines.


How do you replace a pattern only if it’s found, so that it’s executed faster? - Nest the replacement statement: sed ‘/old/ s/old/new/g’ file.txt
