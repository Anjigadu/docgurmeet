The reason were multifold ?

- Coding shop even though interview was for Architectual skills ?

- Justification to existing my skill sets or aspirations

- Underutilization of learning cycles and frequent change of field

- Lack of respect toward indiviual and privacy

- Good advertiesment of core values and prinicple but very poor execuation

- Loud moutehed organization, loud mouthed staff and shouting people move ahead

- Zero craftsmanship and expecting the moon on spoon in less than 10 minutes

- Poor designs. Jump to coding. Most of the designs were overridden and were only coded. That too widely deviant from what client wanted and then mmore rework.

- Empty risk logs. Documentation nill or absent. Everything in indivual's head and training and re-training was big overhead. 

- Zero automation for code development as code warriors did everything by hand

- Indicators
	- Exterement low repeat customers
	- Very high employee attrition rates
	- Overworked and tired staff
	- General shift cab empty
	- Everybody needs privately funded manadatory mobile and internet
