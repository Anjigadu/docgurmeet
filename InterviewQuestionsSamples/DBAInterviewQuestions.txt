MySql is a Relational database management system, provided from open source community. Currently fast growing and hight used RDBMS. MySql Developed by MySql AB.

Recovery Manager (or RMAN) is an Oracle provided utility for backing-up, restoring and recovering Oracle Databases. RMAN ships with the database server and doesn’t require a separate installation. The RMAN executable is located in your ORACLE_HOME/bin directory.

RE #10:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-foreign-key-constraints.html
Foreign keys definitions are subject to the following conditions:
Both tables must be InnoDB tables and they must not be TEMPORARY tables.
In the referencing table, there must be an index where the foreign key columns are listed as the first columns in the same order. Such an index is created on the referencing table automatically if it does not exist.
In the referenced table, there must be an index where the referenced columns are listed as the first columns in the same order.
Index prefixes on foreign key columns are not supported. One consequence of this is that BLOB and TEXT columns cannot be included in a foreign key, because indexes on those columns must always include a prefix length.
If the CONSTRAINT symbol clause is given, the symbol value must be unique in the database. If the clause is not given, InnoDB creates the name automatically.

RE #4
See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/stored-procedures.html
Stored routines (procedures and functions) are supported in MySQL 5.0. A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the server. Once this has been done, clients don’t need to keep reissuing the individual statements but can refer to the stored procedure instead.
Some situations where stored routines can be particularly useful:
When multiple client applications are written in different languages or work on different platforms, but need to perform the same database operations.
When security is paramount. Banks, for example, use stored procedures and functions for all common operations. This provides a consistent and secure environment, and routines can ensure that each operation is properly logged. In such a setup, applications and users would have no access to the database tables directly, but can only execute specific stored routines.
Stored routines can provide improved performance because less information needs to be sent between the server and the client. The tradeoff is that this does increase the load on the database server because more of the work is done on the server side and less is done on the client (application) side. Consider this if many client machines (such as Web servers) are serviced by only one or a few database servers.
Stored routines also allow you to have libraries of functions in the database server. This is a feature shared by modern application languages that allow such design internally (for example, by using classes). Using these client application language features is beneficial for the programmer even outside the scope of database use.
MySQL follows the SQL:2003 syntax for stored routines, which is also used by IBM’s DB2.

TDS(Tabular Data Stream) is a protocol,basically it used to connect the Data Base Server(SQL Server,MySql etc) to your application.

Rollback transaction
Commit transaction
What will be the result produced by this transaction?
Question #6 If you try to execute this statement it will give you error saying “The COMMIT TRANSACTION request has no corresponding BEGIN TRANSACTION.”
Please correct the question.
this should be as
….
….
Rollback transaction SAVE_POINT
Commit transaction
Then the answer will be “oÃ¢â‚¬Å“RameshÃ¢â‚¬Â will be updated to Ã¢â‚¬Å“MaheshÃ¢â‚¬Â, but salaries of engineers will not be updated”
Becasue the SAVE_POINT will save the transaction and rollback will effect only till the save point. so the second part of the query will be rolledback but the statement above the Save Point is saved and will be commited.
Please correct me if i am wrong.
Thanks,

6.Consider the following transaction code:
Begin Transaction
Update names_table set employee_name = Ã¢â‚¬Å“RameshÃ¢â‚¬Â where employee_name = Ã¢â‚¬Å“MaheshÃ¢â‚¬Â
Save Transaction SAVE_POINT
Update salaries set salary=salary + 900 where employee_job = Ã¢â‚¬Å“EngineerÃ¢â‚¬Â
Rollback transaction
Commit transaction
What will be the result produced by this transaction?
Neither “RameshÃ¢â‚¬Â will be updated to Ã¢â‚¬Å“MaheshÃ¢â‚¬Â, nor the salary of engineers will be updated.
bcos the ROLLBACK TRANSACTION statement will undo everything as the save point is not mentioned. ‘ROLLBACK TRANSACTION save_point’ will only undo transaction made after the save point
