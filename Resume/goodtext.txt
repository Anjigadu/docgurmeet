Gautam Saha's Summary

I am Manager, Program Management based out of Sapientâ€™s Bangalore Office. I am a PMI certified PMP, a certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and was involved in CMM Level 5 and CMMI Level 5 certifications as FAR member and as an Assessment Team Member (ATM) in 2006 and 2007 respectively. 

I have managed projects and programs using a hybrid mix of Scrum and XP (eXtreme Programming) both in local and duo-shore models with small to mid-sized globally distributed teams, for more than seven years. I joined Sapient in February of 2007 as an Agile SME and represented Sapient in the Worldwide Agile Conference 2007 in Washington DC. I have a strong understanding of delivery risks and was part of the five member Sapient risk team in 2008 responsible for defining & roll-out of a delivery risk framework.

I have good exposure in client interaction, creation of statement of work (SOW), project plans and reviews and working with executive management for its approval and closure. I have developed cross-functional project teams that not only performed work towards project completion but also involved in training, consulting and mentoring project personnel. I am experienced in requirements gathering and implementing best practices and processes to successfully position projects and programs considering the boundary conditions, internal capabilities and available resources and infrastructure.
